Ansible command to see the memory information on all managed nodes
ansible all -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a 'free'

Note: /etc/ansible/hosts is the default inventory file and when using it
giving -i option in not mandatory
ansible all  -m command -a 'free'

Note: command module is the default module and when using it givin -m
is not mandatory
ansible all -a 'free'




Ansible command to install docker on all managed nodes and check which version
has been installed

ansible all -m shell -a 'curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh'

ansible all -m shell -a 'sh get-docker.sh'

ansible all -m command -a 'docker --version'









Virtualization
----------------
Here we have a bare metal(H/W) on top of which we install the host OS and on the
host OS we install an application called hypervisor.On the hypevisor we install 
the Guest OS and on these guest os's we can install the applications that we require.The advantage is we can run multiple OS's on one H/W.The disadvantage
of this is the applications running on guest os have to pass through so many layers to access the H/W resources.

Containirization
---------------------
Here we have bare metal on whcih we instlal the host OS and on the host OS we install a s/w application called docker engine.On the docker engine we can install an application we want.These applications have to apss through less number of layers to access the H/W resources.

Docker creates process isolation ie it remove the dependency that an application has on the OS and it allows them to run directly on and OS where docker is installed.

Eg: MS SQL server which is designed to work on windows OS can be made to run on Linux or any other os if docker is installed on it.

Docker can create the necessary environment in very less amount of time and it doesnot do any fixed amount of H/W allocation due to reason when the docker contianers are running depending the processes that are running docker engine can do the H/W allocation.

Docker can be used at all the stages of
Build---->Ship---->Run

ie creating the application,deliverying the application and running it in production environment.

Docker comes in 2 flavours
1 Docker CE (Community Edition or Free)
2 Docker EE (Enterprise Edition or Licensed)

Installing Docker on Windows
=============================
1 Open https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
2 Download docker for Windows
3 Install it
4 To run the docker command 
  a) Open Power shell
  b) Execute the docker commands

Note: Docker can be installed on Windows 10 Prof x_64 bit machine or Windows 2016 Server editon

Note: Once docker is installed on Windows it activates an application called Hyper-V and once this Hyper-V is activated it will not allow any other virtulaization technology to run.
