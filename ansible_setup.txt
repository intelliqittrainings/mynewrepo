3 Downgrade python on all these machines
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get -y dist-upgrade
  sudo apt-get install -y  python2.7 python-pip

Setup passwordless ssh between the controller and the managed nodes
1 Connect to server 1
  sudo passwd ubuntu
  sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  Search for "PasswordAuthentication" change it from no to yes
  Restart ssh
  sudo service ssh restart
  Repeat this step on all the managed nodes

  ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private_of_all_managed_nodes

Installing ansible
========================
